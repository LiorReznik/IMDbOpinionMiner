####refactored version 
For now I made the refactored ver at kaggle:

the following changes took place at the refactored version:

1.use of stanza tokenizer instad of keras.
2.better cleaning.
3.data leakage has been fixed.
4.two options for encoding (init embeddings with FastText or embeddings without init)  

soon I will upload a OOP-based ver.
